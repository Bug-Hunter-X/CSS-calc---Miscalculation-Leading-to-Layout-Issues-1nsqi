The issue is solved by including the padding and border in the `calc()` function.  The correct calculation should be:

```css
width: calc(100% - 20px - 10px - 10px); /*Subtracting 10px for padding and 10px for border*/
/* or */
width: calc(100% - 20px - 2 * 10px); /* Assuming padding and border are equal*/ 
```
This ensures the element's width is correctly calculated, regardless of its padding and border.
